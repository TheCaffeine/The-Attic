# The-Attic
A website that boosts and shines the light in the industry where any artist rookie or not can build an identity for themselves by sharing their works in whatever category they wish be it wet media works, dry media works, pottery, jewellery etcetera and get them rated, voted or downvoted, critiqued and even geared up for sale as per the userâ€™s wishes. The user need only create an account and get a global scale outreach by click.
